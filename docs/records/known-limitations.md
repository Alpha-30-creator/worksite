# Known limitations

**Recorded 2026-11-02.** Fourteen mechanisms in this repo and in the pack that work, and the
boundary each one stops at. Each entry names the mechanism in one clause and its boundary in the
next. This is a record, not a task list: an entry changes only when the mechanism does, and then
it changes in the same commit.

These were filed as roadmap tasks and triaged out on 2026-11-02 by the owner, after an
independent audit. A limitation that is written down costs a reader one sentence; the same
limitation as an open task costs every reader a decision about whether to take it.

## `scripts/check.sh`

**Section 3 is not fence-aware.** Its extraction greps the whole file for bracket-paren pairs, so
a link written inside prose or inside a fenced code block is resolved as a real target and fails
the build; a page that documents the link checker cannot show a broken link.

**Section 3 resolves relative links only.** It never resolves an anchor, never a line number, and
never its own coverage — the inline allowlisted string in section 1 is part of what the scan
excludes and is not in `scripts/leak-patterns.txt`.

**`LICENSE`'s exclusion from section 1 is whole-file.** It is applied before the file's content is
read, in both modes, rather than being scoped to the copyright line that needed it, so a line that
would fail section 1 anywhere else in the repo passes there — measured on 2026-11-02 by staging a
pattern-carrying line appended to a copy of it
([2026-11-02-leak-guard-refusal.md](2026-11-02-leak-guard-refusal.md)).

**A refused commit leaves the rejected content in the object store.** `git add` writes the blob
before the pre-commit hook runs and `git restore --staged` only rewrites the index, so the guard
keeps the name out of history and out of every commit while the bytes remain as an unreachable
loose object until something prunes them; the hook cannot reach back past its own invocation.

## Trackers

**Claim locks are not uniform.** Only the file-based adapters — `roadmap-files` and `tasks-file` —
give a real lock, where a pushed commit either wins or is rejected; the hosted adapters re-read
after claiming and trust what they see.

**No adapter answers "what is the status of id X?"** The stale sweep in `ws-start` therefore
decides by set difference against the open, claimed and blocked lists, and asks about what is
left rather than removing it.

**`tracker.lists` names the open and in-progress lists only.** On a three-list board the agent
has nowhere to record where a finished card goes, so it asks, every task, for the life of the
project.

**`tracker.statuses` is declared schema-less.** An adapter needing a board's column names has no
shape to read, so it states that need in its own text rather than relying on one the pack does not
define. Recorded here on 2026-11-02 after p8.33's merge note said it had been — it had not, and
`engineering/trackers.md` was the only file mentioning it, pointing at a task id that no longer
exists.

## The cartridge

**There is no way to say "this command exists, do not run it".** A `null` command means the repo
does not have one, which is a different claim; the do-not-run case is enforced by briefing the
agent, not by the cartridge.

**`schema_version` has no reader.** It is present in `ws-setup`'s cartridge template and in
`ws-shared/examples/cartridge.md`, and a grep over `skills/` finds no skill that reads it — it is
a marker for a human, not a compatibility mechanism.

## Tracks

**The no-upstream refusal when retiring a track is deliberately conservative.** It refuses a
worktree whose branch has no upstream of its own, so it also refuses a branch that was merged and
pushed by another route, and the operator's escape is to override it knowingly.

**An `artifacts: in-repo` project's journal does not travel between machines.** `in-repo`
relocates the plan and only the plan, and the journal mirror is exempt on that layout, so a track
resumed on a second machine resumes from the plan and the tracker.

## The docs and the pack

**`file:line` citations anywhere in these docs are advisory.** The published copy they anchor to
moves whenever a skill gains a line, so the quoted text is the durable half of a citation and the
number is a convenience.

**The pack's gates are desk-verified, not live-verified.** Every description, collision matrix and
refusal has been checked by reading and by composition against fixtures; nothing yet proves that
the loop's triggers fire in ordinary use, and the author of a description is the worst judge of
whether it fires.
